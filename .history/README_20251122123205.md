# gittui
gittui is an open-source command-line tool that brings your Git repository to life inside the terminal. Using ASCII characters and minimalist text graphics, it draws interactive historical charts of branches, merges, and commits—giving you immediate, intuitive insight into your project's version control history without ever leaving your shell.
